// Coding in function grabDoll. function accept 1 parameter:dolls. it's a string array, a list of some dolls.

// You need traverse dolls by using for loop. If element is "Hello Kitty" or "Barbie doll", you should push it to a bag(bag is an array, I've defined in the function); if it's other strings, we should use continue skip it.

// When the bag has three element, bag is full. You should use break jump out the loop; If bag is not full, you should traverse dolls until the last element.

// Return the bag after for loop finished.

// You should use for, break and continue in your code. otherwise, your solution may not pass this kata.

// If you forgot how to push an element to array, please refer to lesson 4.

function grabDoll(dolls) {
  var bag = [];
}

console.log(
  grabDoll([
    "Mickey Mouse",
    "Barbie doll",
    "Hello Kitty",
    "Hello Kitty",
    "Hello Kitty",
    "Snow White",
  ])
);
